      I have Bipolar Disorder Type 2. I still have so much to learn about me and
      my neurodivergent brain. I'm still in the phase of combating internalized
      ableism. This page lists all myths about bipolar disorder that I thought
      were true and caused me to doubt that I have bipolar disorder. There are
      more myths than these but there are the ones that I have personally knew.
    </p>
    <p>I'm not a doctor by the way and this can't serve as medical advice.</p>
    <h2>What's Bipolar Disorder</h2>
    <p>
      Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric condition where one experiences series
      of mania and depression. Mania being the overly energetic phase and
      depression being the low mood phase accompanied. This is type 1. I have
      type 2. Type 2 means we experiences hypomania instead of mania, less
      severe but it can affect life just as much.
    </p>
    <h2>Myth #1: It's all my fault</h2>
    <p>
      This is written in my own perspective when I was having depression.
      Especially in times before I got diagnosed and therefore, I wasn't able to
      think that there's something wrong with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sucks. It felt like I'm insignificant in this world. Hell, I felt like
      the world is better without me. Why the hell do I make so much mistakes. I
      kept asking these questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm so so happy these thoughts came to an end. I have bipolar disorder and
      it makes me feel these stuff. It's not my mistake, it's my condition.
      Sure, it affects me like I'm unable to finish things on time. Time is my
      enemy. But I don't have to be perfect. It's fine to be average.
    </p>
    <h2>Myth #2: Mania is pure bliss</h2>
    <p>
      Depression being the sucky part, I assumed mania is the not sucky part,
      seeing them as polar opposites. Oh how naive this is. Mania and hypomania
      isn't pure bliss. In my case, hypomania is mixed in with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember experiencing hypomanic episode but I'm unable to recognize it
      all because I recognize I'm having anxiety as well. I thought I can't be
      hypomanic. Well I'm wrong, I can have anxiety during hypomania.
    </p>
    <h2>Myth #3: At a time, it's only either mania or depression</h2>
    <p>
      Nope! Before and after mania and depression, there's a phase where one
      feel neither manic nor depressed. I suppose this is obvious. Of course
      when moving from one to another, one has to pass the midpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      What led me to believe this is the case is maybe due to how the articles
      about bipolar disorder emphasizes the mania and depression and not the
      phases in between. Well, I guess there's not much to say about those
      phases.
    </p>
    <h2>And that's all I have</h2>
    <p>
      Like I said, I'm still learning about my condition. Who knows, I might
      give this page an update in the future.
    </p>
    <p>And I hope you find these things interesting. Have a good day!</p>
