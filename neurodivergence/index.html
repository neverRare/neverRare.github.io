    <p>
      I have Bipolar Disorder 2. I still have so much to learn about me and my
      neurodivergent brain.
    </p>
    <p>I might talk about my condition here but for now, here's this page.</p>

      I actually have a lot to say, but I'm struggling to present it in as clear
      format as possible. Maybe another reason is my internalized ableism
      creeping in and causing me to doubt the accuracy of all of these.
